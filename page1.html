    <p>This is for a personal project, the idea is that it works as a sort of block alphabet like Korean Hangeul, but for an alien species. Vowels modify based on whether their sound is long or short, and the glyph changes further if the vowel is near any of the three glide phonemes. Consonants flip and invert between positions depending on whether they start or end syllables of a word. Don't take this language as a college elective if you suffer sore throat.</p>
